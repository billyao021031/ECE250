# ECE250

This repository contains the projects in ECE250(Algorithm & Data Structure) at University of Waterloo.

Project 0 (Array): Write a C++ program that manages a playlist of songs. The program allows users to: (1)add songs to the end of the list, (2)Select a song to be played, and (3) delete a song from the list

Project 1 (Queue & Stack): The goal of this project is to design and implement a dynamic deque data structure. A deque is a queue that stores elements in an ordered list and allows insertions and deletions at both ends in O(1) time. 

Project 2 (Hashtable): In this project, you will implement a hash table data structure for storing student records. Students are represented by a student number (stored as an unsigned int) and a last name (stored as a single string without spaces or special characters). 

Project 3:
