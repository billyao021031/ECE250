# ECE250

This repository contains the projects in ECE250(Algorithm & Data Structure) at University of Waterloo.

## Project 0 (Array): 

Write a C++ program that manages a playlist of songs. The program allows users to: (1)add songs to the end of the list, (2)Select a song to be played, and (3) delete a song from the list

## Project 1 (Queue & Stack): 

The goal of this project is to design and implement a dynamic deque data structure. A deque is a queue that stores elements in an ordered list and allows insertions and deletions at both ends in O(1) time. 

## Project 2 (Hashtable): 

In this project, you will implement a hash table data structure for storing student records. Students are represented by a student number (stored as an unsigned int) and a last name (stored as a single string without spaces or special characters). 

## Project 3 (Tree): 

In this project, we implemented a trie data structure in which each node represents a letter ('a' is 0th node). We can insert, search, print and delete words from the trie, also spellcheck some word-spelling based on what is stored in the trie. Ex. input --> "yo", output --> "you your yours". If the user did not follow the input restriction, an illegal statement alert would pop out.

## Project 4 (Graph): 

In this project, you have to design and implement a graph data structure to store a weighted graph. In addition, design and implement an efficient algorithm to find a Maximum Spanning Tree (MST) of a subgraph.The dataset consists of space separated triples of numbers such as:
17569 2629 0.045455
17569 3520 0.041667
17569 3535 0.25
...
The first two numbers, representing “researcher ID”, are always integers in the range of 1 to 23133. In the data, if two researchers, a and b, appear on a line, that means that a collaborated with b. The third number is an “influence weight”, between 0 and 1 (inclusive), that represents the importance of the collaboration to the second researcher’s career.
